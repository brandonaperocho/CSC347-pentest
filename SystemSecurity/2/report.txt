You have the VM, so you essentially have physical access to the system. Figure 
out one or two very different ways to get /etc/shadow and /etc/passwd from the 
VM, without initially having any accounts or passwords. Document your approach. 
Is there any way to prevent these attacks?

1) If the hacker is able to choose which device to boot from, then the hacker 
can plug in his own harddrive to boot from and mount the file systems to 
read/modify data.  This means that the hacker will be able to copy the 
/etc/shadow and /etc/passwd onto their harddrive without knowing any 
usernames/passwords on the original machine since they are booting from their 
own harddrive and mounting the file systems. Additionally, if the machine is 
password protecting the boot sequence the hacker can try to take out the 
battery from the computer inorder to try and reset the bios and check if the 
boot sequence password was reset.

Prevention: 
- Password protect BIOS so hacker can't modify system settings
- Password protect GRUB, remove GRUB timeout to prevent hacker from booting linux
- Disable interactive step through boot sequence
- Physically lock the system


2) The hacker can install a keylogger over the same network that the target 
computer is on. Alternatively, the hacker can install a keylogger onto the 
machine through a USB device/CD and wait for a user to log in. Once the user 
logs in, the hacker will have retrieved the keystrokes used to log in and can 
log in as that user. Once the hacker is in the system, they can copy the 
/etc/passwd as any user and /etc/shadow if the user they are logged into 
has root access or is part of a privilege group. 

Prevention:

- If keylogger is sent over via the same network, have antivirus to scan 
  incoming file before introducing it into the system.
- If keylogger is from the USB device/CD, have antivirus to scan the device
  before allowing access to the system.
- Frequently change passwords so that keyloggers information will be behind
- Use Firewall. If the Firewall detects any suspicious activity occuring 
  can prevent inbound and outbound data.
- Encrypt keystrokes
