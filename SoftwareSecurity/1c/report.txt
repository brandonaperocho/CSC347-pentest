By using sqlmap, the different types and versions of software were found for 
the web application which are listed below:

web server operating system: Linux Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron)
web application technology: PHP 5.2.4, Apache 2.2.8
back-end DBMS: active fingerprint: PostgreSQL >= 8.3.0 and < 8.4.0

PostgreSQL >= 8.3.0 and < 8.4.0:
Firstly, if we continue to use the current version of PostgreSQL(8.3.*) for 
the DBMS there would be many vulnerabilities that could be exploited such as 
DoS Exec Code Overflow, privillage escallation, buffer overflow, SQL injection, 
XSS and many more. According to cvedetails.com there are approximately ~20 
vulnerabilities for PostgreSQL versions 8.3.*. Although upgrading would be a 
good idea since many of the vulnerabilities from older versions have been 
fixed, there are still vulnerabilities for the newer versions that allow the 
hacker to gain more control of the system then the previous versions of 
PostgreSQL. It is better to have a little bit of the system comprimised rather 
then a big chunk of the system comprmised. Upgrading to version 8.3.22 would 
get rid of alot of the major vulnerabilties such as SQL injection, and others
without comprimising other parts of the system.

Apache 2.2.8:
Vulnerabilities: Total of 32 exploits and vulnerabilities such as DoS, code 
execution, overflows, XSS according to cvedetails.com.

This should be upgraded to the newest version(3.1) because all of the listed
vulnerabilities have been fixed and very little exploits have been found for 
the newest versions. These exploits for the newer version are very minor and 
do not give the hacker access to any debug information either.

PHP 5.2.4:
Vulnerabilities: Total of 111 exploits and vulnerabilities such as memory 
corruption, code execution, sql injection, privillage escalation, directory 
traversal according to cvedetails.com.

This version of PHP should be upgraded because the newest version has fixed 
all of the major vulnerabilities that allow the hacker to gain control of the 
system. Additionally, very few vulnerabilities have been found for the newer 
version and the ones that have been found are no where near as sevre as the 
current version of PHP.

Linux Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron):
This version of linux should not be upgraded as there are very few vulerabilties 
found for it and the ones that exist do not allow the hacker to gain much information. 
The worst vulnerability would be XSS but that can be fixed by whitelisting.
